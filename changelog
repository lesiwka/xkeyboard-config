xkeyboard-config (0.6-6) breezy; urgency=low

  * Add level3(ralt_switch_for_alts_toggle), which maps RALT to
    [ l3switch, group_next ], which is the desired behaviour for a three-level
    keyboard with multiple layouts present (see below).
  * Add list of layouts which use third/fourth levels to base.lists.part.
  * Add l[x] + o -> s mappings for all four levels; for all three-level
    layouts, map grp:alts_toggle -> level3(ralt_switch_for_alts_toggle) for
    that group only.  Note that this precludes (sensibly) adding layouts
    which use a different key than RALT for the l3 switcher to
    $threelevellayouts, although this is only cosmetic (closes: Ubuntu#13527).
  * Adjust altwin(meta_win) to cope with this; only modify the first level of
    LALT and RALT.
  * Only modify the first level in compose(ralt).
  * Bind Alt_R to Mod1 in pc.
  * Remove (completely false) ONE_LEVEL declarations for LALT, RALT, LWIN and
    RWIN through level3.
  * Add Conflicts on libxkbfile1 (<< 7.0.0-3), so we force upgrading to a
    fixed version; l[x] + o -> s mappings in the rules will cause earlier
    versions of xkbfile to choke.

libxkbfile (7.0.0-3) breezy; urgency=low

  * Allow options to appear with other mappings, as this restriction seems to
    make no sense.
