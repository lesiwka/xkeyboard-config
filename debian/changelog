xkeyboard-config (0.6-5breezy1) breezy-updates; urgency=low

  * Add de_CH -> ch(de) and fr_CH -> ch(fr) mappings.
  * Add level3(ralt_switch_for_alts_toggle), which maps RALT to
    [ l3switch, group_next ], which is the desired behaviour for a three-level
    keyboard with multiple layouts present (see below).
  * Add list of layouts which use third/fourth levels to base.lists.part.
  * Add l[x] + o -> s mappings for all four levels; for all three-level
    layouts, map grp:alts_toggle -> level3(ralt_switch_for_alts_toggle) for
    that group only.  Note that this precludes (sensibly) adding layouts
    which use a different key than RALT for the l3 switcher to
    $threelevellayouts, although this is only cosmetic (closes: Ubuntu#15372).
  * Adjust altwin(meta_win) to cope with this; only modify the first level of
    LALT and RALT.
  * Only modify the first level in compose(ralt).
  * Bind Alt_R to Mod1 in pc.
  * Remove (completely false) ONE_LEVEL declarations for LALT, RALT, LWIN and
    RWIN through level3.
  * Add Conflicts on libxkbfile1 (<< 7.0.0-3), so we force upgrading to a
    fixed version; l[x] + o -> s mappings (and l + o -> s) in the rules
    will cause earlier versions of xkbfile to choke.

xkeyboard-config (0.6-3) breezy; urgency=low

  * Remove ca mapping from rules.ml_s.part, re-merge the rules.  Add default
    'default' mapping to symbols/ca, which emulates the old rule-based
    behaviour.  Add ca_enhanced mapping to rules.ml_s.part.  Add ca(fr) and
    ca_enhanced to base.xml.in (closes: Ubuntu#15040).
  * Fix merge.sh to be srcdir != destdir safe.
  * Re-add compose:caps (closes: Ubuntu#15790).
  * Add hr(alt) variant, thanks Ante Karamatic (closes: Ubuntu#14667); also
    add hr_US -> hr(alt) mapping in rules.

xkeyboard-config (0.5-4) breezy; urgency=low

  * Replaces on old versions of xlibs-data.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  4 Aug 2005 19:30:21 +1000

xkeyboard-config (0.5-3) breezy; urgency=low

  * Add /usr/lib/X11/xkb and /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb symlinks; add Pre-Depends
    on x-common as we now use /usr/lib/X11 and want that to be in a
    transitioned state.  Add Conflicts on old (monolith) versions of libx11-6
    as that's where the XKB symlinks used to live.

xkeyboard-config (0.5-2) breezy; urgency=low

  * Remove 'compiled' symlink in debian/rules, averting conflict with
    xbase-clients.
  * Bump xlibs Conflicts/Replaces to -39, to account for fun with broken
    packaging.
