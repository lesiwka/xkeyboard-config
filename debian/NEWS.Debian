xkeyboard-config (0.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * This package is intended to replace xlibs in the modular X.Org release 7.0.
    Layout files have been moved to /usr/share/X11/xkb, which means that some
    applications need to be modified to search for XKB files in this directory.
    Please read /usr/share/doc/xkb-data/README.Debian for detailed instructions
    to let your applications find XKB files.
